# Multi-stamping-Machine
the goal of this machine is to count the number of answer sheets and stamp them. While the academic staff was counting and stamping the answer sheets, they took much time, effort, and many working hands.

we made this machine to Save time, and effort, instead of three or four people counting and stamping answer sheets, this machine will do this task, besides having a little working hand, so we need human help but not like before. -The need for human effort will be reduced, in addition to saving more time, and then itâ€™s the beginning of normalizing artificial intelligence in various academic fields to make life easier for academic staff.
