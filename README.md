# Multi-stamping-Machine
the goal of this machine : 
Counting the number of answer sheets and then stamping them.  While the academic staff were counting and stamping the answer sheets, they took a lot of time, efforts and many working hands.  

we made this machine to:
Save the time ,effort, instead of three or four people counting and stamping answer sheets, this machine will do this task, besides having a little working hand, so we need human help but not like before. 
-The need for human effort will be reduced, in addition to saving more time and then itâ€™s the beginning of normalizing artificial intelligence in various academic fields to make life easier for academic staff.
